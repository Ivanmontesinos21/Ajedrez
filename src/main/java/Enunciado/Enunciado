Local chess game (0 .. 7 p)
Make the chess game with the following basic specifications:

Use abstract classes and methods for simulate the behaviour of chess pieces (heritage and polymorphism).DONE
Use you own List with generic types to implement the deleted piece storage that shows the pieces deleted. Doing but this give me lazyness
Use a Map to represent the chess board. Done
Control user input data TODO with
Use enum types for the color and shape of the chess pieces.  Done
Highlight cells with the following possible movements. Done
The game ends when a player kill the king TODO
/* If this work try to do check function   */
Use the MVC design pattern. TODO
/*Does the interface visual be like the joaquin gave to me in the exemple    */

/* The most IMPORTANT thing is to create the class game to put all the methods needed to make the game work correctly */


/* if the game doesn't work well  i obtained and  F
and im gonna shout Viva Espa√±a  with british accent*/



Extensions (6 .. 10 + 1):
Implement streams to manipulate collections /* Check if i can change other collections with streams */
Implement check function
/* the check functions is when the king is in danger we have to seen the next movements of the pieces of the rival to see if hes make a check
   if this happens we only are allowed to move the king */
Implement checkmate function/* Is when  doesn't matter where you move you already lost it  "You'r a loser"*/
Implement save the game in a file Todo Is more simple all game but interesting to try all movements too
All game /* Joaquin say is more easy to do than all movements */
All movements /* try too after does all game    */
Implement castling Todo but first is needed to do check function
/*Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved.
  There are no pieces between the king and the rook.
  The king is not currently in check.
  The king does not pass through or finish on a square that is attacked by an enemy piece. /*
Implement network play /* Is the more dificult part only try if I finish all the other and want to try a challenge       */
Implement the needed unitary tests (JUnit) (those ones student considers as the needed ones) TODO but in extension not in necessary things;
Implement the way to change the application colors and store them in a file. You can use a Singleton pattern to do it.
/* I don't know how to do it i have to do a research to try to do this
  Joaquin is  explaining  later the files
  */
